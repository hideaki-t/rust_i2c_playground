* toy programs using Rust(currently beta or nightly needs to be used) and i2cdev to read temperature and relative humidity from Si7021 and to read data from TSL2560
* tried only on an aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu environment which is armbian(mainline kernel->/dev/i2c-0) on Pine64+
* and also only tried to build these programs on Windows PC `cargo +beta build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release`
